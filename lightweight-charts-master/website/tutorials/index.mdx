## Analysis indicators

The [analysis indicator](./tutorials/analysis-indicators) examples below serve as a starting point for creating your own indicators.
You can use them directly in your projects.
Follow the links to see the indicators' source code on GitHub.

To run them locally, follow the [setup instructions](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/tree/master/indicator-examples/) in the repository.
You can also explore each indicator in action on a [live demo page](https://tradingview.github.io/lightweight-charts/indicator-examples/).
